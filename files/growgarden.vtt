00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:51.060
annoying

432
00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:51.330
or

433
00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:52.320
unwanted.

434
00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:53.460
So

435
00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:53.820
you can

436
00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:54.180
use

437
00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:54.510
it with

438
00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:55.230
family,

439
00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:56.130
friends

440
00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:56.460
or

441
00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:56.790
even

442
00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:56.940
at

443
00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:57.420
work.

444
00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:57.690
As

445
00:03:57.690 --> 00:03:57.900
you

446
00:03:57.900 --> 00:03:58.170
talk

447
00:03:58.170 --> 00:03:58.440
about

448
00:03:58.440 --> 00:03:58.590
your

449
00:03:58.590 --> 00:03:59.070
boss's

450
00:03:59.070 --> 00:03:59.880
child,

451
00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:01.740
some

452
00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:02.220
weeds

453
00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:02.550
may

454
00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:02.820
not

455
00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:03.030
be

456
00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:03.420
pretty

457
00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:03.630
to

458
00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:03.930
look

459
00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:04.470
at,

460
00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:05.940
but

461
00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:06.630
flowers

462
00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:06.840
in

463
00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:07.200
full

464
00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:07.890
bloom

465
00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:08.250

466
00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:09.330
beautiful

467
00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:11.280
blooms

468
00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:11.550
that

469
00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:11.880
appear

470
00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:12.330
later

471
00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:12.600
than

472
00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:13.230
others

473
00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:13.560
can

474
00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:13.800
be

475
00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:14.280
among

476
00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:14.370
the

477
00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:14.850
most

478
00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:15.960
surprising.

479
00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:17.620
When

480
00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:17.710
a

481
00:04:17.710 --> 00:04:18.340
person

482
00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:18.700
is a

483
00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:19.000
late

484
00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:19.810
bloomer,

485
00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:20.200
it

486
00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:20.800
means

487
00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:21.100
they

488
00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:21.580
become

489
00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:22.780
successful,

490
00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:23.950
attractive,

491
00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:24.640
or

492
00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:25.150
develop

493
00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:25.270
a

494
00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:25.960
skill

495
00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:26.290
at

496
00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:26.410
a

497
00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:26.770
later

498
00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:27.070
time

499
00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:27.190
in

500
00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:27.550
life

501
00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:27.790
than

502
00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:28.120
other

503
00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:28.870
people.

504
00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:30.820
So

505
00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:31.300
being

506
00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:31.690
a late

507
00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:32.440

509
00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:33.070
good

510
00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:33.730
thing.

511
00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:35.230
Being

512
00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:35.320
a

513
00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:35.890
blooming

514
00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:36.610

515
00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:37.060
is

516
00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:37.780
not.

517
00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:38.920
This

518
00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:39.490
insult

519
00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:40.150
describes

520
00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:40.870
someone

521
00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:41.200
who

522
00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:41.380
is

523
00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:41.950
lacking

524
00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:42.160
in

525
00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:42.520
common

526
00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:43.390
sense,

527
00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:44.440
severely

528
00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:45.280
lacking.

529
00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:47.290
Now

530
00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:47.650
let's

531
00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:47.950
hear

532
00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:48.340

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:48.580
these

534
00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:49.390
expressions

535
00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:49.930
used

536
00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:50.230
in a

537
00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:50.530

538
00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:51.460

544
00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:54.870
walk.

545
00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:55.290
I

546
00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:55.560

Nobody

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:01.230

here.

561
00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:02.370
It's

562
00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:02.760
like a

563
00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:03.120

588
00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:12.210
weekend.

589
00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:13.200
How

590
00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:13.320

594
00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:14.940
Oh,

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:15.090
they're

596
00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:15.390
doing

597
00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:15.930
fine.

598
00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:16.230
I

599
00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:16.560
hadn't

600
00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:16.800
seen

601
00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:17.010

602
00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:17.460
sister

603
00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:17.820
and her

604
00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:18.210
son

605
00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:18.510

606
00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:18.630

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:18.990
long

608
00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:19.770
time,

609
00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:20.490
so

610
00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:20.820
it was

611
00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:21.180
nice to

612
00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:21.540
catch up

613
00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:21.720
with

614
00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:22.230
them.

615
00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:22.890
How

616
00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:23.280
old is

617
00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:23.460
your

618
00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:24.120
nephew?

619
00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:24.480
He

620
00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:24.840
just

621
00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:25.200
turned

622
00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:26.190
16

623
00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:26.520
and

624
00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:26.820
he

625
00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:27.030
is

626
00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:27.600
growing

627
00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:27.900
like

628
00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:28.050
a

629
00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:28.830
weed.

630
00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:29.430
He's

631
00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:29.790
taller

632
00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:30.000
than

633
00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:30.330
I

634
00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:30.540

637
00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:31.800
he's

638
00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:32.070
so

639
00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:32.760
smart.

640
00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:33.120
He

641
00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:33.570
actually

642
00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:33.870

business

646
00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:35.760
idea

647
00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:36.150
that

648
00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:36.450
turned

649
00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:36.720
out

650
00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:37.050
to be

651
00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:37.200

652
00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:37.650
perfect

653
00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:38.280
solution

654
00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:38.580
for a

655
00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:39.060
problem

656
00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:39.360
I was

657
00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:40.110
having.

658
00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:40.920
Sounds

659
00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:41.310
like your

660
00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:41.820
nephew

661
00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:42.180
is a

662
00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:42.600
budding

663
00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:43.440
businessman.

664
00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:43.800
He

665
00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:44.400
totally

666
00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:45.060
is.

667
00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:45.510
His

668
00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:46.020
ideas

669
00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:46.410
have been

670
00:05:46.410 --> 00:05:46.800
better

671
00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:47.100
than a

672
00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:47.490
woman

673
00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:47.880
on my

674
00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:48.480
development

675
00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:49.230
team.

676
00:05:49.470 --> 00:05:49.800
I

677
00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:50.580
actually

678
00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:50.970
had to

679
00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:51.330
fire

680
00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:51.510
her

681
00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:51.870
last

682
00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:52.560
week.

683
00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:53.070
What

684
00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:53.730
happened?

685
00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:54.180
Well,

686
00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:54.540
it was

687
00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:55.420
strange.

688
00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:55.830
She

689
00:05:55.830 --> 00:05:56.010
was

690
00:05:56.010 --> 00:05:56.520
fine

691
00:05:56.520 --> 00:05:56.850
when you

692
00:05:56.850 --> 00:05:57.240
talked

693
00:05:57.240 --> 00:05:57.450
with

694
00:05:57.450 --> 00:05:57.660
her

695
00:05:57.660 --> 00:05:58.020
one on

696
00:05:58.020 --> 00:05:58.650
one.

697
00:05:58.650 --> 00:05:59.070
But

698
00:05:59.070 --> 00:05:59.430
every

699
00:05:59.430 --> 00:05:59.820
time

700
00:05:59.820 --> 00:05:59.970
we

701
00:05:59.970 --> 00:06:00.270
met

702
00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:00.510
with

703
00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:01.350
buyers,

704
00:06:01.350 --> 00:06:01.830
she

705
00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:02.220
turned

706
00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:02.730
into

707
00:06:02.730 --> 00:06:02.880
a

708
00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:03.660
blooming

709
00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:04.500
idiot.

710
00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:05.860
Blooming

711
00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:06.540
idiot?

712
00:06:06.690 --> 00:06:06.900
I

713
00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:07.140
haven't

714
00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:07.380
heard

715
00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:07.770
that in

716
00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:07.860
a

717
00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:08.220
long

718
00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:08.910
time.

719
00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:09.360
What

720
00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:09.660
did she

721
00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:10.260
do?

722
00:06:10.410 --> 00:06:11.100
Well,

723
00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:11.280
at

724
00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:11.700
client

725
00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:12.300
meetings,

726
00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:12.750
she

727
00:06:12.750 --> 00:06:12.960
would

728
00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:13.380
make

729
00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:13.920
strange

730
00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:14.880
noises

731
00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:15.240
like

732
00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:15.330
a

733
00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:16.020
bird

734
00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:16.350
when

735
00:06:16.350 --> 00:06:16.710
others

736
00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:16.890
were

737
00:06:16.890 --> 00:06:17.790
talking.

738
00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:18.660
Then

739
00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:19.050
when she

740
00:06:19.050 --> 00:06:19.470
wanted

741
00:06:19.470 --> 00:06:19.620
to

742
00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:19.980
make a

743
00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:20.430
strong

744
00:06:20.430 --> 00:06:21.120
point,

745
00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:21.510
she

746
00:06:21.510 --> 00:06:21.630
would

747
00:06:21.630 --> 00:06:21.930
throw

748
00:06:21.930 --> 00:06:22.500
pencils

749
00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:22.800
around

750
00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:22.920
the

751
00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:23.580
room.

752
00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:24.030
I

753
00:06:24.030 --> 00:06:24.270
mean,

754
00:06:24.270 --> 00:06:24.480
who

755
00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:24.840
does

756
00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:25.560
that?

757
00:06:26.130 --> 00:06:26.280
A

758
00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:26.730
blooming

759
00:06:26.730 --> 00:06:27.240
idiot.

760
00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:28.440
Exactly.

761
00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:28.920
And

762
00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:29.190
she

763
00:06:29.190 --> 00:06:29.580
wasn't

764
00:06:29.580 --> 00:06:29.820
your

765
00:06:29.820 --> 00:06:30.270
garden

766
00:06:30.270 --> 00:06:30.900
variety

767
00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:31.650
idiot.

768
00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:32.040
What

769
00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:32.370
was so

770
00:06:32.370 --> 00:06:32.760
special

771
00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:33.030
about

772
00:06:33.030 --> 00:06:33.240
her

773
00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:34.050
idiocy?

774
00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:35.220
She

775
00:06:35.220 --> 00:06:35.700
seemed

776
00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:36.420
mentally

777
00:06:36.420 --> 00:06:37.500
unstable,

778
00:06:37.650 --> 00:06:38.160
so

779
00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:38.400
I

780
00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:38.730
nipped

781
00:06:38.730 --> 00:06:38.970
that

782
00:06:38.970 --> 00:06:39.450
problem

783
00:06:39.450 --> 00:06:39.750
in the

784
00:06:39.750 --> 00:06:40.410
bud.

785
00:06:40.710 --> 00:06:41.040
It's

786
00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:41.310
best

787
00:06:41.310 --> 00:06:41.670
to take

788
00:06:41.670 --> 00:06:42.060
care of

789
00:06:42.060 --> 00:06:42.180
a

790
00:06:42.180 --> 00:06:42.600
problem

791
00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:42.840
like

792
00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:43.110
that

793
00:06:43.110 --> 00:06:43.860
quickly.

794
00:06:44.070 --> 00:06:44.370
I'm

795
00:06:44.370 --> 00:06:44.760
sure you

796
00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:45.030
made the

797
00:06:45.030 --> 00:06:45.240
right

798
00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:45.990
decision.

799
00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:46.440
Your

800
00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:46.860
business

801
00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:47.190
has been

802
00:06:47.190 --> 00:06:47.490
really

803
00:06:47.490 --> 00:06:48.450
successful.

804
00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:48.810
You

805
00:06:48.810 --> 00:06:49.050
must

806
00:06:49.050 --> 00:06:49.380
really

807
00:06:49.380 --> 00:06:49.620
love

808
00:06:49.620 --> 00:06:49.950
what you

809
00:06:49.950 --> 00:06:50.610
do.

810
00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:50.970
I

811
00:06:50.970 --> 00:06:51.510
do.

812
00:06:51.690 --> 00:06:51.990
And

813
00:06:51.990 --> 00:06:52.230
when it

814
00:06:52.230 --> 00:06:52.560
comes

815
00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:52.890
to my

816
00:06:52.890 --> 00:06:53.430
career,

817
00:06:53.430 --> 00:06:53.820
you could

818
00:06:53.820 --> 00:06:54.420
say

819
00:06:54.420 --> 00:06:54.810
I'm a

820
00:06:54.810 --> 00:06:55.110
late

821
00:06:55.110 --> 00:06:55.890
bloomer.

822
00:06:56.070 --> 00:06:56.430
When

823
00:06:56.430 --> 00:06:56.760
I was

824
00:06:56.760 --> 00:06:57.300
younger,

825
00:06:57.420 --> 00:06:57.690
I

826
00:06:57.690 --> 00:06:57.900
had

827
00:06:57.900 --> 00:06:58.200
so

828
00:06:58.200 --> 00:06:58.470
many

829
00:06:58.470 --> 00:06:58.950
jobs

830
00:06:58.950 --> 00:06:59.190
that

831
00:06:59.190 --> 00:06:59.430
I

832
00:06:59.430 --> 00:07:00.150
hated.

833
00:07:00.300 --> 00:07:00.600
It

834
00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:00.840
took

835
00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:01.020
me

836
00:07:01.020 --> 00:07:01.350
much

837
00:07:01.350 --> 00:07:01.740
longer

838
00:07:01.740 --> 00:07:01.950
than

839
00:07:01.950 --> 00:07:02.250
other

840
00:07:02.250 --> 00:07:02.820
people

841
00:07:02.820 --> 00:07:03.120
to

842
00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:03.420
find

843
00:07:03.420 --> 00:07:03.870
work

844
00:07:03.870 --> 00:07:04.200
that I

845
00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:04.860
love.

846
00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:05.760
I'd

847
00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:06.120
rather

848
00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:06.420
be a

849
00:07:06.420 --> 00:07:06.720
late

850
00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:07.410
bloomer.

851
00:07:07.530 --> 00:07:07.860
I

852
00:07:07.860 --> 00:07:08.160
went to

853
00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:08.370
high

854
00:07:08.370 --> 00:07:08.760
school

855
00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:09.000
with a

856
