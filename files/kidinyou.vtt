149
00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:25.690
So

150
00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:25.990
when

151
00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:26.440
Sam's

152
00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:26.950

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:27.970
the

156
00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:28.780
progress

157
00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:28.990
of the

158
00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:29.710

159
00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:30.220
she

160
00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:30.430
could

161
00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:31.030
say,

162
00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:31.810
So

163
00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:32.110
how

164
00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:32.470
is your

165
00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:33.010

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:33.400
coming

167
00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:34.180

168
00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:35.760
Yes.

169
00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:36.540
Using

170
00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:37.290
baby

171
00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:37.560
in

172
00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:37.860
this

173
00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:38.460
way

174
00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:38.730
is

175
00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:39.360
slightly

176
00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:40.290
informal,

177
00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:41.460
but

178
00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:41.820
it is

179
00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:42.120
very

180
00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:42.780
common

181
00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:43.140
and

182
00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:43.800
okay

183
00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:44.070
to

184
00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:44.760
use

185
00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:45.090
in

186
00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:45.360
just

187
00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:45.690
about

188
00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:46.140
any

189
00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:47.250
situation.

190
00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:48.060
The

191
00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:48.720
opposite

192
00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:48.990
of

193
00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:49.410
caring

194
00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:49.710
for a

195
00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:50.310
baby

196
00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:50.610
would

197
00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:50.790
be

198
00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:51.300
throwing

199
00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:51.690
it out

200
00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:51.960
with

201
00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:52.110
its

202
00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:53.160
bathwater.

203
00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:54.490
What?

204
00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:54.900
That

205
00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:55.170
is

206
00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:55.940
terrible.

207
00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:56.340
You might

208
00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:56.490
be

209
00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:57.210
saying.

210
00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:58.410
Yes,

211
00:01:58.410 --> 00:01:58.710
it

212
00:01:58.710 --> 00:01:59.070
is

213
00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:00.060
terrible.

214
00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:00.930
Except

215
00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:01.260
when

216
00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:01.650

being

572
00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:05.460
often

573
00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:06.720
uncomfortable.

574
00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:07.940
Do

575
00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:08.150
you

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:08.450
know

577
00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:08.750
what

578
00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:09.080
is

579
00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:09.650
not

580
00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:10.700
uncomfortable

581
00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:11.960
playing?

582
00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:13.450
Children

583
00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:13.720
do

584
00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:13.870
it

585
00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:14.650
naturally

586
00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:15.070

587
00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:16.210
effortlessly.

588
00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:17.730
So

589
00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:17.970
when

590
00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:18.240
we

591
00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:18.690
say

592
00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:18.840
a

593
00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:19.560

595
00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:20.490
child's

596
00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:21.180
play,

597
00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:21.690
we

598
00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:22.170
mean

599
00:05:22.170 --> 00:05:22.380
it

600
00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:22.740
is

601
00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:23.280
very

602
00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:23.610
easy

603
00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:23.730
to

604
00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:24.450
do.

605
00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:26.050
Note

606
00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:26.350
that

607
00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:26.590
this

608
00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:27.250
expression

609
00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:27.580
can

610
00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:27.880
be

611
00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:28.000
a

612
00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:28.300
little

613
00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:28.990
mean

614
00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:29.950
because

615
00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:30.190
it

616
00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:31.030
suggests

617
00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:31.330
that

618
00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:31.480
the

619
00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:31.900
work

620
00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:32.170
is

621
00:05:32.170 --> 00:05:32.500
so

622
00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:33.280
simple.

623
00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:33.760
Even

624
00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:33.880
a

625
00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:34.330
child

626
00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:34.540
could

627
00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:34.780
do

628
00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:35.230
it,

629
00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:36.130
which

630
00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:36.310
is

631
00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:37.090
actually

632
00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:37.360
its

633
00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:37.570
own

634
00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:38.470
expression.

635
00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:39.980
Let's

636
00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:40.400
say

637
00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:40.670
in a

638
00:05:40.670 --> 00:05:41.240

639
00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:41.540
one

640
00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:41.840

641
00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:42.530

says

643
00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:43.610

really

650
00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:47.750
difficult.

651
00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:48.890
You

656
00:05:50.570 --> 00:05:51.390
Really?

657
00:05:51.410 --> 00:05:51.740
I

She

00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:45.430
it

770
00:06:45.430 --> 00:06:45.820

00:06:45.820 --> 00:06:46.240
taking

772
00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:47.110

773
00:06:47.110 --> 00:06:47.560
from

00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:47.650
a

00:06:47.650 --> 00:06:48.490

776
00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:49.640
Of

00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:50.180
course,

778
00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:50.930
babies

779
00:06:50.930 --> 00:06:51.320

784
00:06:53.790 --> 00:06:54.180
But

785
00:06:54.180 --> 00:06:54.540
if a

790
00:06:56.730 --> 00:06:57.300

801
00:07:02.070 --> 00:07:02.340
He

802
00:07:02.340 --> 00:07:02.670
might

803
00:07:02.670 --> 00:07:03.330
cry

804
00:07:03.330 --> 00:07:03.570

be

806
00:07:03.750 --> 00:07:04.710
upset.

807
00:07:04.710 --> 00:07:05.130
But

808
00:07:05.130 --> 00:07:05.370
he

809
00:07:05.370 --> 00:07:05.580
is

810
00:07:05.580 --> 00:07:06.150
helpless

811
00:07:06.150 --> 00:07:06.660
compared

812
00:07:06.660 --> 00:07:06.960
to the

813
00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:07.710
adult.

814
00:07:08.590 --> 00:07:08.920
And

815
00:07:08.920 --> 00:07:09.340
that

816
00:07:09.340 --> 00:07:09.670
is the

817
00:07:09.670 --> 00:07:10.480
situation

818
00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:10.870
with your

819
00:07:10.870 --> 00:07:11.830

820
00:07:12.340 --> 00:07:12.730
She

821
00:07:12.730 --> 00:07:13.180
just

822
00:07:13.180 --> 00:07:13.660
walked

823
00:07:13.660 --> 00:07:14.080
in

824
00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:14.440
and

825
00:07:14.440 --> 00:07:14.770
picked

826
00:07:14.770 --> 00:07:15.070
up your

827
00:07:15.070 --> 00:07:15.880
notes.

828
00:07:16.450 --> 00:07:17.050
She

829
00:07:17.050 --> 00:07:17.380
is the

830
00:07:17.380 --> 00:07:18.190
adult.

831
00:07:18.340 --> 00:07:18.610
The

832
00:07:18.610 --> 00:07:19.150

00:07:19.510 --> 00:07:20.350
candy.

835
00:07:20.650 --> 00:07:21.190
And

836
00:07:21.190 --> 00:07:22.450
unfortunately,

837
00:07:22.450 --> 00:07:22.990

00:07:23.380 --> 00:07:24.130
baby.

840
00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:25.540
Now,

841
00:07:25.540 --> 00:07:25.750
if

842
00:07:25.750 --> 00:07:26.110

845
00:07:27.190 --> 00:07:27.580

parents

850
00:07:29.530 --> 00:07:29.890

851
00:07:29.890 --> 00:07:30.550
demand

852
00:07:30.550 --> 00:07:30.820

00:07:30.820 --> 00:07:30.970
the

854
00:07:30.970 --> 00:07:31.480
person

855
00:07:31.480 --> 00:07:32.080

856
00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:32.470

857
00:07:33.130 --> 00:07:33.550
This

858
00:07:33.550 --> 00:07:33.940
isn't

859
00:07:33.940 --> 00:07:34.180
so

860
00:07:34.180 --> 00:07:34.870
bad.

861
00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:35.560
Going

862
00:07:35.560 --> 00:07:35.830
to a

863
00:07:35.830 --> 00:07:36.220
candy

864
00:07:36.220 --> 00:07:36.910
store

865
00:07:36.940 --> 00:07:37.180
is

866
00:07:37.180 --> 00:07:37.810
fun.

867
00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:39.310
For

868
00:07:39.310 --> 00:07:39.580
many

869
00:07:39.580 --> 00:07:40.150
kids,

870
00:07:40.150 --> 00:07:40.600
being

871
00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:40.840
in a

872
00:07:40.840 --> 00:07:41.320
candy

873
00:07:41.320 --> 00:07:41.950
store

874
00:07:41.950 --> 00:07:42.250
is

875
00:07:42.250 --> 00:07:42.670
pure

876
00:07:42.700 --> 00:07:43.480
joy.

877
00:07:43.840 --> 00:07:44.410
Wide

878
00:07:44.410 --> 00:07:44.860
eyed

879
00:07:44.860 --> 00:07:45.040
and

880
00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:45.670
smiling

881
00:07:45.670 --> 00:07:46.030
from

882
00:07:46.030 --> 00:07:46.270
ear

883
00:07:46.270 --> 00:07:46.450
to

884
00:07:46.450 --> 00:07:47.110
ear.

885
00:07:47.140 --> 00:07:47.530
They

886
00:07:47.530 --> 00:07:47.950
run

887
00:07:47.950 --> 00:07:48.310
from

888
00:07:48.310 --> 00:07:48.730
sweet

889
00:07:48.730 --> 00:07:48.910
to

890
00:07:48.910 --> 00:07:49.660
sweet,

891
00:07:49.750 --> 00:07:50.650
imagining

892
00:07:50.650 --> 00:07:50.950
how

893
00:07:50.950 --> 00:07:51.610
everything

894
00:07:51.610 --> 00:07:51.820
will

895
00:07:51.820 --> 00:07:52.630
taste

896
00:07:52.630 --> 00:07:52.990
and

897
00:07:52.990 --> 00:07:53.350
trying

898
00:07:53.350 --> 00:07:53.500
to

899
00:07:53.500 --> 00:07:54.310
decide

900
00:07:54.310 --> 00:07:54.760
what

901
00:07:54.760 --> 00:07:54.910
to

902
00:07:54.910 --> 00:07:55.840
choose.

903
00:07:56.750 --> 00:07:57.410
So

904
00:07:57.410 --> 00:07:57.680
if

905
00:07:57.680 --> 00:07:58.130
someone

906
00:07:58.130 --> 00:07:58.340
is

907
00:07:58.340 --> 00:07:58.730
very

908
00:07:58.730 --> 00:07:59.510
excited

909
00:07:59.510 --> 00:07:59.840
about

910
00:07:59.840 --> 00:08:00.320
all

911
00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:00.470
the

912
00:08:00.470 --> 00:08:01.520
possibilities

913
00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:01.820
in

914
00:08:01.820 --> 00:08:02.120
front

915
00:08:02.120 --> 00:08:02.240
of

916
00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:02.720
her,

917
00:08:03.050 --> 00:08:03.380
we

918
00:08:03.380 --> 00:08:03.830
say

919
00:08:03.830 --> 00:08:04.160
she

920
00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:04.400
is

921
00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:04.760
like

922
00:08:04.760 --> 00:08:04.850
a

923
00:08:04.850 --> 00:08:05.360
kid

924
00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:05.690
in a

925
00:08:05.690 --> 00:08:06.080
candy

926
00:08:06.080 --> 00:08:06.770
store.

927
00:08:07.700 --> 00:08:08.030
For

928
00:08:08.030 --> 00:08:08.750
example,

929
00:08:08.750 --> 00:08:09.440
whenever

930
00:08:09.440 --> 00:08:09.680
I

931
00:08:09.680 --> 00:08:09.950
go

932
00:08:09.950 --> 00:08:10.310
into a

933
00:08:10.310 --> 00:08:11.270
library,

934
00:08:11.270 --> 00:08:11.570
I

935
00:08:11.570 --> 00:08:11.930
feel

936
00:08:11.930 --> 00:08:12.290
like

937
00:08:12.290 --> 00:08:12.410
a

938
00:08:12.410 --> 00:08:12.770
kid

939
00:08:12.770 --> 00:08:13.070
in a

940
00:08:13.070 --> 00:08:13.460
candy

941
00:08:13.460 --> 00:08:14.240
store.

942
00:08:14.540 --> 00:08:14.870
There

943
00:08:14.870 --> 00:08:15.080
are

944
00:08:15.080 --> 00:08:15.320
so

945
00:08:15.320 --> 00:08:15.590
many

946
00:08:15.590 --> 00:08:16.100
books

947
00:08:16.100 --> 00:08:16.340
I

948
00:08:16.340 --> 00:08:16.670
haven't

949
00:08:16.670 --> 00:08:17.330
read

950
00:08:17.330 --> 00:08:17.630
and

951
00:08:17.630 --> 00:08:17.780
I

952
00:08:17.780 --> 00:08:18.050
don't

953
00:08:18.050 --> 00:08:18.260
know

954
00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:18.590
where

955
00:08:18.590 --> 00:08:18.800
to

956
00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:19.160
start

957
00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:19.970
first.
